#pViz.js/VEP viewer: A browser side only application to view Ensemble Variant Effect Predictor output files
The [Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor](http://ensembl.ebi.com/vep) produces '.vep' files with, among others, protein positioned features of variant.

We propose a tool to parse such an output, retrieve the protein sequence from [Ensembl REST API](http://rest.ensembl.org), and align the features on the sequence, grouped by categories.
##Data sources
Any '.vep' file can be fitted in the tool, either on of the test set or a loaded local files. Files with up to 1.5M lines can be parsed in a chrome browser in approximatively 10 seconds.
###Parsed features
Any features with protein position are displayed. By default, only the protein with an 'ENSP.+' identifier can be displayed by default as the sequence is retrieved on a server (change the Ensembl REST url in the configuration menu to connect to a local store).

The field in the 'Extras' column are displayed when mousing over a feature.

The application can be used live at [http://research-pub.gene.com/pviz/app/vep](http://research-pub.gene.com/pviz/app/vep)

##Usage
Enter a gene name to display the related protein.

Zoom in the sequence by dragging the mouse and zoom out by double clicking.

Clone the project, then

    npm install
    bower install
    #you may have to select a jQuery version: 2.1 looks perfect

    #if grunt was not installed with -g
    alias grunt=./node_modules/grunt-cli/bin/grunt

    grunt server

Et Voil√†

###Deploy

    grunt build
    rsync --recursive --delete dist/* your.host:/your/path/
