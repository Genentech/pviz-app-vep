DOING

DONE
- I like the type-ahead, but I would like a notification that a gene I put in has not been found (right now, it just does not respond). 
- auto close details div on mouse out + 3 seconds
- The textual textual annotation at the left hand side (ie. 'non_synonymous_codon') sometimes overlaps with the actual mutation block (see, RAD18). Maybe there is a better way to provide those annotations, perhaps as colored blocks at the left hand side with a legend explaining them?
- find a way it's obvious we can click and zoom
- position handler whould be on the lower axis bar
- add a grey line in lieu of sequence if font is too small.
- "Select Legend" was confusing, maybe "Color By" is better? Probably should have one selected by default?
- The position axis should probably be on the bottom. Right now, the axis sort of divides up the plot, and its position seems arbitrary.
- find a way to make the text on the upper marker to be smalll - big - small
- change enlighting box color + grid / use tooltip 
- output header with a '+' or whatever expand icon
- when using test case, put TP53 as default and lauch it
- remove test.vep
- submit a decent sized test case, available for public use
- add a real color palette instead of 5 fixed values
- cleanup help file
- add google analytics
- gruntified
- add alert if FileReader API is not available in browser
- add a config box, stored in cookies: urlEnsemblREST API at first
- facet entries by SIFT, PolyPhen, DOMAINS, MOTIF_NAME, HIGH_INF_POS, CELL_TYPE, SV (removing parentheses when present)
- enlight variant feature when mousing over facets
- add a favicon
- autocomplete on HGNC
- report error for failed to retrieve ENSP
- allow multiple ENSPs to be displayed for one HGNC
- recover entries by HGNC instead of ENSPs
- help page (with Genetench mention)
- file loader for local stored files
- better extras fields display
